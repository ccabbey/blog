# What's this

This repo is used as archive of my personal blog, to record notes/thoughts/ideas in work and study. For I have not thought a better way to write blog, so plan is to temporarily archive these blogs as markdown files and upload to this repo. Basiclly, there will be 2 main subjects, which are :

## 1. Programming-related

This subject include study notes, focused on techniques. My major interests are in **Python/R**, and some data visualization tools such as **pandas**, **ggplot2**.

## 2. Data science

This subject include my thinking in data collection, analysis and visualization, focused on theoritical stuff. Obviously I'm an expert of it,there will be mistakes and childish points, but as they say, the early bird catches the worm. I will be using MS EXCEL as platform for now and gradually transit to Python/R.
